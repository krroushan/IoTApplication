# Privacy Policy Publishing Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you publish your privacy policy on your website and submit it to Google Play Store.

## Files Created
1. **PRIVACY_POLICY.html** - HTML version for website publishing
2. **PRIVACY_POLICY.txt** - Plain text version (backup/reference)

## Step 1: Publish on Your Website

### Option A: Direct HTML Upload
1. Upload `PRIVACY_POLICY.html` to your website server
2. Place it in a publicly accessible location (e.g., `https://ampushworks.com/privacy-policy.html`)
3. Ensure the URL is accessible without login/authentication

### Option B: Integrate into Your Website
1. Copy the HTML content from `PRIVACY_POLICY.html`
2. Integrate it into your existing website template
3. Add a link to the privacy policy in your website footer
4. Ensure it's accessible at a permanent URL

### Recommended URL Structure

### Important Notes:
- The URL must be publicly accessible (no login required)
- The URL must use HTTPS (secure connection)
- The URL must be accessible from all regions

## Additional Requirements
