**Response:**

Our IoT Motor Control app remotely controls motor devices via SMS. The app sends SMS commands (MOTORON, MOTOROFF, STATUS) to IoT motor control panels and receives SMS responses with motor status data. The app ONLY accesses SMS messages directly related to motor control operations from configured device phone numbers. We do NOT read, store, or transmit any other SMS messages. SMS usage is clearly disclosed in our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service available in-app.

**Character count: 400/500**
